DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT - LAPTOP
================================

   - Dev data base on E:\tfl

   - output to sub dir

   - Dependancies
     - The 'VFPOLEDB.1' provider must be registered on the local machine

	 DBF DATA - WINDOWS 7 64 BIT
	 
	This is for anyone that still needs to use the VFPOLEDB driver for their 
	32-bit apps, but need to do their development in Windows 7 64-bit.  
	Installing it should be the same as Vista, but the steps below I did 
	not need to do in Vista 64, only Windows 7 64...

	1.  If the Driver is installed, uninstall it.
	2.  Open a Command Prompt running "As Administrator"
	3.  Run the VFPOLEDBSetup.msi from the command prompt.

	It will install successfully and work correctly for your 32 bit apps.  As 
	all of you should know by now, it will not work on 64-bit 
	compiled applications
	
	* Rebuild app and target the x86 as the target platform
